## Gulp Compose

Gulp Compose is a build layer made for the framework, library, and open source enthusiast. Gulp Compose promotes organization and separation of code by influencing you to break out the pieces of your codebase into small parts. Gulp Compose takes those moving parts, merging them together and running other gulp features (like babelify, minify, concat, etc.) to give you production ready distribution files.
